Subject: [PATCH 1/2] ## Check-in notes #### Package Changes   * Added an entry
 to the .gitignore for WebStorm IDE's, this prevents un-needed files from
 being checked in.   * Updated Request to version 2.71.0     * Some logic for
 how JSON serialazation has changed, I have updated the request method to
 reflect that changed   * Updated xmlBuilder to 8.0.0     * Slight update to
 syntax for creating a new xml doc : xmlBuilder.begin().ele(this.element); 
 * Had to update Utility.areEqual to reflect a change in how xmlBuild stores
 values of child elements   * Updated nock to version 8.0.0,   * Updated Mocha
 to 2.4.5
#### Code Changes
  * Plivo.js : Updated the core plivo object in plivo.js to be a true object rather than a globally scoped function.  This is related to issue https://github.com/plivo/plivo-node/issues/39.
    The restApi method will now return a new object every time for every invocation.
  * plivoError.js : decoupled the plivoError object from the root plivo.js file.
  * plivoResponse.js : decoupled the response object from the core plivo.js file.
  * I made sure all tests were passing prior to pull reuqesting
